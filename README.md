# 🌟 The Data Journey of Anushka Sarkar  

> *“Numbers tell stories, and I love uncovering them.”*  

From a curious computer science student to a results-driven Data Analyst and budding developer, my journey has been a blend of **learning, experimenting, and creating impact**.  



## 🛤️ Chapter 1 – The Spark  

Growing up fascinated by **logic, patterns, and problem-solving**, I dove into programming during my B.Sc in Computer Science at Babu Banarasi Das University. My curiosity led me to explore **Python, SQL, and Web Development**, where I realized that data isn’t just numbers—it’s the **pulse of decision-making**.  

During my early internships, I learned that **cleaning data is like sculpting marble**; raw and unrefined, but full of potential. From cold-calling leads to analyzing thousands of rows of employee and sales data, I discovered the magic of turning chaos into **actionable insights**.  



## 🔍 Chapter 2 – The Data Explorer  

At **NxtWave**, I managed complex datasets across HR, Finance, and Onboarding, boosting **data accuracy by 25%**. I built dashboards in Power BI that transformed departmental numbers into clear, visual stories, helping teams make faster, smarter decisions.  

During my **Data Analyst internship at Aeries Technology**, I didn’t just crunch numbers—I built predictive models, automated workflows, and reduced processing time by **27%**. Every line of Python code, every visualization was a step toward **data mastery**.  



## 💡 Chapter 3 – The Innovator  

Innovation became my mantra at **BluCognition**, where I optimized reporting and automated data collection. A 20% reduction in task time wasn’t just efficiency—it was freeing up human creativity to focus on insights.  

I also explored the **digital world**, designing interactive websites, quizzes, and calculators during web development internships. Each project taught me **the importance of user experience, modular code, and scalability**.  



## 📊 Chapter 4 – The Problem Solver  

From building an **RSA encryption simulator** to designing **RaktLink**, a location-based blood donation platform, I’ve tackled problems that demand both logic and empathy. My projects blend **technology with real-world impact**, whether predicting Amazon review sentiment or analyzing movie profitability.  

**Project Highlights:**  
- **MovieIndustry-EDA:** Identified profitable genres, budget sweet-spots, best release months, and ROI trends for studios.  
- **RetailSight 360:** Automated retail sales pipelines, improving decision-making by **39%**.  
- **Nutrition Analytics:** Built ML models predicting quality and trends, improving model accuracy by **30%**.  



## 🚀 Chapter 5 – The Continuous Learner  

Certifications and trainings have been my **compass and toolkit**:  
- Python, Data Science, and ML at **IIT Bombay & IBM**  
- React.js from **Meta**  
- Advanced Excel, SQL, and Agile Methodologies  

I believe learning is **never complete**. Every dataset, every project, every line of code is a lesson.  



## 🌐 Chapter 6 – Beyond Data  

I don’t just analyze—I create, collaborate, and communicate:  
- Built automation scripts reducing manual work by **40%**  
- Managed social media and events for NGOs, learning leadership and professional etiquette  
- Ranked 4th in the **AI Agent Hackathon**, contributing to real-time AI solutions  

Data isn’t my only passion—**solving problems, building connections, and telling stories through technology** drives me.  



## 🔮 Chapter 7 – What’s Next  

I aim to leverage my skills to **transform raw data into actionable intelligence**. Whether it’s **improving business efficiency, predicting trends, or creating scalable tech solutions**, I strive to make an impact with every line of code, every visualization, and every analysis.  

> *Numbers are not just numbers—they are stories waiting to be told. I am here to tell them.*
